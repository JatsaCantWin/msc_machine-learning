# Student Performance Prediction

This project is a machine learning exercise aimed at predicting student performance in exams based on a fictional educational dataset. The project was developed as part of a machine learning course and is intended for educational purposes only.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset created specifically for educational purposes. It contains information about student performance in exams, including demographics such as gender and ethnicity, as well as variables related to academic background, such as parental level of education.

The dataset is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have access to the Jupyter Notebook enviornment.

## Usage

The main notebook for this project is `student_performance_prediction.ipynb`. The script inside loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, and trains a machine learning model to predict student performance. The output of the script is the accuracy of each model on a held-out test set.

## Contributing

As this project is intended for educational purposes only, contributions are not necessary. However, if you would like to suggest improvements or report any issues, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
